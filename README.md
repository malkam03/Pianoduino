## Getting Started
Since this is a hardware and software project, these instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your device for development and testing purposes.  


### Prerequisites

**Arduino Circuit**
First you need to build the [circuit](PCB/Pianoduino/Mainboard.brd) if you have a Yamaha PSR-E303, or you can modify it to fit your keys circuit.

**Arduino IDE** to edit and upload your code.
You can find the instructions of installation on the Arduino's [page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) depending on your operative system.

**Autodesk Eagle** to edit the circuit.
You can find the instructions of installation on the autodesk's [page](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download) depending on your operative system.

## Deployment

Just upload your code to the arduino + circuit and play :musical_keyboard:.
